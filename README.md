# Album Popularity Trends

This Python project takes the input of the user and displays a plotly scatter chart that shows the popularity of an artist's albums over the years.
This popularity is determined and attained via the Spotify API. This project heavily utilizes the Spotify API to get an artist's page, albums, and album stats.
Initially this project was made to view the popularity of Mariah Carey's official album releases so her results are the most tailored.
